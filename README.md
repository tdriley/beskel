# beskel
My Bare-bones Skeleton for quickly setting up a node.js app written with ES6 modules. Note: as this uses the `--experimental-modules` feature to load .mjs files, Node 8.5.0 or higher is required. If you don't want to run it this way, you could use webpack to bundle the ES6 modules into a single file for running.
## Getting started
To download and install:
```
git clone git@github.com:tdriley/beskel.git && cd beskel
```
To start the app:
```
npm run start
```
